# Scheduler-Management
Developed a "Scheduler Management" system using Java, JavaScript, and Cron Tab to automate and manage scheduled tasks efficiently.
• Built the backend logic in Java to handle the scheduling, execution, and monitoring of various tasks, ensuring reliability an d robustness.
• Utilized Cron Tab for scheduling automated tasks at specified intervals, such as data backups, report generation, and notifications.
• Created an interactive user interface with JavaScript, allowing users to easily define, modify, and delete scheduled tasks th rough a web-based
dashboard.
• Integrated Java with the Cron Tab to dynamically manage and update task schedules based on user input and system requirements.
• Implemented error handling and logging mechanisms to track the status of scheduled tasks and troubleshoot issues quickly.
• Optimized the scheduler for scalability, ensuring it can handle multiple tasks concurrently without performance degradation.
• Developed a notification system to alert users about the status of scheduled tasks, such as successful execution or failures.
• Conducted thorough testing and debugging to ensure seamless functionality across different environments.
